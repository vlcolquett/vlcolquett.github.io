## ðŸ”¥ Premise
Homepage that connects other live repositories for some hobbies -> [vlcolquett.github.io](https://vlcolquett.github.io)

Style is derived from Phantom by [HML5 UP](https://html5up.net).
## ðŸ”° Quick Notes
- default is index.html
- to access another page within this repo -> vlcolquett.github.io/**<filename>**
- to access another project/repository -> vlcolquett.github.io/**<project_name>**
    - project must be public
    - I do this instead of laying it all here to separate code bases
  
_Some project ideas may need different platform for hosting to comply with Terms & Conditions of GitHub._
## ðŸŽ¯Features
- Tiles linking to various projects
  - assets/css/main.css line 2637 gets rid of cross lines in tiles for Phantom template
- Footer with links to other platforms
